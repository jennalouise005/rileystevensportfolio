        <p><strong>1.</strong> The Empty Spaces In The Sky</p>
        <p>My sister thinks about the empty spaces in the sky,
She’s a falling leaf, slowly going off 
The edge. My sister goes side to side,
Up and back down,
Rotating until she comes still.

My sister thinks about the empty spaces in the sky,
She believes grandma beckons her up there,
Or maybe it's the dog she said good-bye to,
Or maybe it's the devil she claims to be her only friend.

My sister thinks about the empty spaces in the sky,
 While I don’t understand, she beckons me to stay,
She doesn't want me to fly,
Worried I’ll never land for the rest of my days.

        <p><strong>2.</strong> I’m the Problem</p>
        <p>Do you ever think maybe
That I’m actually the cause?
The reasons dreams die
Or the reason I’m so hollow?
Maybe its because they fall hard
And I don’t fall enough.
I only fall for this idea,
While they all fall for love.
I get so ambitious
That they can't reach my ideals,
I make them cry
While I feel nothing at all,
They fall in love,
While I climb out.
My ladder, wobbly
Built all on doubt.
They probably deserve better,
Even the ones who have hurt me.
Or maybe I don't deserve anyone.
Maybe I’m destined to be lonely
With only an idea of love,
But never the real thing.

        <p><strong>3.</strong> 2am</p>
        <p>2am is for the poets who cannot sleep, their minds too fast it really takes the leap, a heart made of glass that shatters way too fast.
But shattered isn’t broken, shattered isn’t forever right? Shattered can be glued back together, you just replace the old with the new and boom you’re ready to bloom.
It’s 3am now and I’m still awake, my hands are shaking with my voice aching with the words that I’ve always wanted to say, but the only things I can take out of my mind that won’t scare my mom are what I have on these pages. 
Because my pain is forever, that's what I was born to believe, that's what I will believe until the day I die, and death scares me.
An hour flashes by and it's 4am. I'm sorry if I’m scattered, I’m sorry if I stutter, and I’m sorry if I seem unable to be in control.
Because my mind is no longer present,the darkness in my mind is all that is left in these early hours of the day, where I am wide awake.
Sleep is like a foreign cousin to me, whom I do not understand, So I lie there smiling into the dark rich eyes of my cousin, just nodding along until I can’t do it anymore. 
Then the lights come back on and I’m told to get dressed, get ready, because your day is only beginning, we like to watch you sit there in silence while all your friends are smiling. 
And all you do seems fake, because you have lost who you are, you have lost what you want, and you have lost yourself most of all. 
The scars on the palms of your hands from holding on too tight to nothing are now oozing with want and desire, to be free.
But what does free even mean, because you can’t have it, because nothing stays the same for you except your want to sleep.
Your dull eyes, tired mind, and bags that are only described as endless rainbows of purples and blues.
But you're still sane, 
You're still okay.
Okay as okay can be.
And you are most definitely still here, so stay calm and just breathe.
Because people need you,
And honestly,
That’s all you need.

 <p><strong>4.</strong> Forgotten</p>
        <p>The daughter of a saint, you’d think she wouldn’t be insane, how could she disgrace? 
Yet she is in pain, it aches and it aches and it aches.
No longer breathing, but her heart keeps beating. She’s suffocating as her chest keeps aching, unable to speak, her mind is a race.
The words she wants to vomit are locked behind a cage, the very cage she built around her own heart and her will to forgive and forget, the key is long forgotten, given to a boy who didn’t really want her.
There is a way she wants to follow in the footsteps of her Father, but her heart screams “no''. 
The Saint, that's her mother, cries “thats okay” in a voice that could’ve easily said “You’re a bother”.
 “Such a disgrace to our name” because there's no pride in just “okay”, just okay is like white bread and she will never be like wheat bread.
She is tired, deflated, lonely, holding onto every  last bit of hope that hasn’t made her lose her mind.
Drowning in her own mind of restlessness, floating in holy water that's burning every bit of flesh.
Why can’t we just let her be forgotten and put her out of her misery. 
She is too unholy to save, drowning in vain by the boy she would’ve much rather just forgotten.

    <p><strong>5.</strong> Empty Promises</p>
        <p>Looking for a reason that I deserve a happy life
Looking for a reason to continue believing
In this thing we call life
But I can only find the broken
I can never find something working
But I think that’s the story of my life 
And I doubt it’ll be changing
Mom I’m lonely
Mom please help me
“How are you doing?”
“Mom I’m empty”
Mom please save me
Mom please help me
But all that comes out is 
“Mom I’m happy”
Mom I need someone to explain to me that I’m worthy
Mom I can’t find it
Mom where is it
The promises I was given in this life I live
The promise of happiness
The promise of a happy ending
A fairytale that I don’t believe I’ll ever be reaching
I can’t take it 
I can’t find it
I’m out here looking
But I can’t find it 
I can’t find anything that isn’t broken
I’m picking up the shattered glass
It cuts my palms 
It cuts my hands
But mom I forgive you for these promises were meant to do good
But all it does is burden me with ideas I will never achieve
Mom it's okay
It's not your fault
To make you feel better
To make you happy
I’ll keep looking
I promise I’m looking
One day maybe I’ll collect all these pieces and put them back together
So they won't all be broken. So they’ll be whole again.
